These are the rules for Ekrixi to maintain a fun experience for everyone.

[color=#ff0000]No Tolerance Rules[/color]
No Tolerance Rules are No Tolerance. Upon being noticed or ahelped, you will be banned permanently with a chance of appeal.

[color=#a4885c]NT0[/color]. EKRIXI AT IT'S HEART IS A ROLEPLAY SERVER. YOU ARE EXPECTED TO IMITATE AN ACTUAL PERSON.

[color=#a4885c]NT1[/color]. Do not harass other users, for any reason.
  - Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)
[color=#a4885c]NT2[/color]. Do not post, link to, or provide instructions to access illegal or adult material. Sexual and NSFW content is prohibited both in-game and on the Discord server.
[color=#a4885c]NT3[/color]. Do not use real slurs, or fictional slurs based on real slurs.
  - This includes gestures, whether real or fictional, that could be construed as deeply offensive, e.g. the Nazi/Roman salute.
[color=#a4885c]NT4[/color]. Do not evade bans or use multiple accounts.
[color=#a4885c]NT5[/color]. Do not use an account name that is offensive.
[color=#a4885c]NT6[/color]. Do not use non-English languages to communicate.
[color=#a4885c]NT7[/color]. Do not engage in ERP, do not discuss sexual topics IC or OOC.

[color=#ff0000]LOW TOLERANCE[/color]
Low Tolerance Rules are rules that are enforced heavily but you should be warned/reprimanded/punished on first/second offenses.

[color=#5ca488]LT0[/color]. Don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
  - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
  - Do not convert rounds into 'crew PvP rounds'.

[color=#5ca488]LT1[/color]. Do not grief or deathmatch before round-end.
[color=#5ca488]LT2[/color]. Do not share in-character information in OOC or anywhere else, including Discord server.
[color=#5ca488]LT3[/color]. Your character's name must be believable within the universe of Ekrixi.
[color=#5ca488]LT4[/color]. Do not use information used outside of in-character means.
[color=#5ca488]LT5[/color]. Do not overthrow your captain without admin permission.
[color=#a4885c]LT7[/color]. Do not use bugs or exploits. When in doubt whereas something is an exploit or bug - ahelp.
[color=#a4885c]LT8[/color]. Command personnel are expected to act competent in their roles.

[color=#ff0000]Medium Tolerance[/color]
Medium Tolerance Rules means that you should just follow them. These are usually for minor offenses regarding roleplay or general etiquette.

[color=#885ca4]MT1[/color]. Do not use OOC slang in IC such as textspeak (:), :D, XD, etc)

[color=#ff0000]ESCALATION RULES[/color]
When escalating, follow this checklist.
1. Self Defense: Is there an immediate threat to the safety of my life, another crewmember's life, or the ship's stability? If yes, proceed to step 4.
2. Negotiation : Is it possible for me to talk my way out of this situation? If yes, proceed to step 3.
3. Disable the threat (verbally), then go back to step 1.
4. Disable the threat (lethally or non-lethally).
5. Alert security or other command personnel if you haven't already.
