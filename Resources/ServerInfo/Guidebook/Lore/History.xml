  # History

  Around the range of year 100,000 and 200,000 A.D located in the old world, a ship with 10,000 passengers was launched into the abyss packed with technology equivalent to 2300 A.D alongside with an FTL drive.

  The length of how long the ship sailed for, why the ship set sail or even what happened to the old world, however a few years after the ship crashed onto some foreign world - the Post Ruina years began, starting at zero.

  The coil-spin drive is (for now) the most affordable way of setting sail. By vibrating a coil very fast, it causes a spin-like velocity which is able to shatter spacetime and warp you into a seperate space, allowing you to travel to a location provided you have the coordinates.

  Around the year 2498, groups such as ACKs, Frontier Stability Corporation, IncSek, and A2B began enforcing heavy tariffs and taxes upon independent imports and export, severely crippling independent crews.

  Not many people know what actually caused start of the Decline, whether it were Independent crews firing first or the corporations, however a war began the two lasting less than 9 years with a major corporation win.

  Many crews were either forced into one of the groups, or forced into the edge of charted space, also known as the Edge or the Frontier.

  The year is 2523, now begins your story.
