  # A2B Corporation

  A2B is a private secure package shipping company that delivers mass amounts of cargo from point A to point B securely, known very well for delivering mass amounts of cargo safely throughout charted space without breaking it. It is the youngest faction founded in 2497. The name "A2B" was made as their main mission is to move cargo (usually civilian cargo) from point A to point B.

  ## History
  A2B was founded in 2497 by Krazk-Ieks serving in the CoreGov scouts, after a cryo-frozen cake shipped to his girlfriend in the core worlds from the edge ended up delivered completely destroyed. Upon being honorably discharged from the CoreGov scouts in 2498, he set out to start A2B, taking out a loan and developing advanced automated cargo freighters taking around 2 years before the first A2B launch. The first launch was able to move several tonnes of cargo, fragile and not, from the edge to a CoreGov world. By 2501, the corporation had reached around 100 star systems dedicated solely for packaging, and began training pilots with advanced methods to reach their destination in time.
  
  ## Relation with Independents after The War
  After the war, A2B and the Independents stayed neutral. A2B dropped all tariffs and taxes after being threatened with violence as they had barely even had 10 star systems. They had been brought into the fight by IncSek as a way to knock out competition while seeming friendly. There have been a few incidents regarding A2B and Independents since the war, however none have been major enough to cause any distaint toward either faction.
