  # IncSek Incorporated

  A former ink manufacturing and paper press that evolved into general electronic manufacturing, and soon the research and invention of weaponry.
  
  ## History
  IncSek was founded in 2304 as a subsidiary for "The Edge Times", specifically as a printing press under the name "IncPrz". It began to expand as it gained more funding, eventually making it's own ink and paper for cheap. However, around the year 2343, IncPrz began to distance itself further from pen and ink manufacturing as it began to delve into circuit printing and basic ship frame engineering. It started to create a prototype for weapons, however their first invention was the Heavy Laser series, refined over the 200 years of existence to the one we know and love today. Eventually, "The Edge Times" was bought out by IncPrz and the whole company was rebranded to IncSek Incorporated, inventing useful weaponry such as the stun baton, and the disabler that other factions (and even Independents) use today. Eventually, the company had captured 612 star systems by 2401 and 1,042 by 2501, doubling in size in just 100 years.
  
  ## Relation with Independents after The War
  After the war, IncSek and the Independents remained hostile. There have been multiple incidents that IncSek have tried to cover up regarding Independents since the war.
