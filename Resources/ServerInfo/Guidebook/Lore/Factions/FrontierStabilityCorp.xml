  # Frontier Stability Corporation

  The Frontier Stability Corporation, shortened to the FSC is a private military corporation that focuses on stabilizing the edge via force, notorious for colonization of multiple star systems and the glassing of planets that refuse to cooperate.

  ## History
  The FSC was founded in 2264 after a violent seperation from IncSek involving the theft of more than half of the fleet sent to survey the edge. In which they began their hostile recruitment campaign in which they traveled the edge and established colonies, recruiting people to travel the stars and deploying propaganda in the FSC's favor. The FSC was a naturally hostile faction, preferring to shoot first and ask later should they not be informed of ships traveling through this area. Sectors occupied by the FSC were deemed a "confirmed danger" by 2291.
  
  ## Relation with Independents after The War
  After the war, FSC and the Independents remained hostile. There have been multiple publicized incidents of FSC firing upon Independents since the war.
