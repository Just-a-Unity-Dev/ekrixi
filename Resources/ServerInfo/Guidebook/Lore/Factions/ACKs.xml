  # ACKs

  ACKs is a defection of CoreGov's scouts, focusing mainly on technological advancement and control over the Core. Multiple weapons in the black marketed manufactured by a corporation enmasse are by ACKs.

  ## History
  A scout fleet around the year 2407 suddenly vanished. Around the year 2417, IncSek and FSC fleets began to vanish right around the area that the original scout fleet disappeared. A CoreGov fleet was sent to investigate, however only one ship returned with video evidence of an attack by an unknown target. This video was the first ever sighting of ACKs, a defection of CoreGov's scouts, focusing mainly on technological advancement and control over the Core. An army fleet was sent to combat the defectors, causing the Siege of Cypheus lasting for 2 months involving the bombings of ACKs' territory by CoreGov fleets and occasional skirmishes. However, on the final day of the siege, ACKs appeared with advanced robotic technology and began to wreck havock on the CoreGov army, forcing them to retreat.
  
  Since the Siege of Cypheus, ACKs and CoreGov have been neck in neck trying to get technologically better than the other, so that they can wipe the other one out first. The reasons for the organization of ACKs are unknown, however a theory suggests that the ACKs' leaders wished for a better CoreGov and plan to perform a revolution on the Core, and have since been fighting each other on the Core's border worlds.
  
  ## Relation with Independents after The War
  After the war, ACKs and the Independents remained hostile. There have been multiple publicized incidents of ACKs firing upon Independents since the war.
