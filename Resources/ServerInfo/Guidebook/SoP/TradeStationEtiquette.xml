  # Trade Station Etiquette

  When in a trade station, remember that this is Not Yours. This is not your home, and you should treat it with respect, otherwise, you're at the hands of the trade station crew. It may be a place to sell stuff for you, but it is way more for them. It is not just their workplace but their home, they've built this ship and maintained it for possibly years. Imagine if you own a store, and then suddenly a bunch of hooligans come in, wreck your shit, sell you your own products, kill you, and leave without cleaning up. You'd be pissed, too.

  ## 1. Do not steal their shit
  I mean it. Apologies for breaking formality, but don't steal their shit. It's theirs, and you're only able to borrow. So, don't fucking steal their shit!

  ## 2. Treat staff with respect
  In a chain of command, they are higher than your captain. It is their home, and you are simply visitors in it. Don't insult them, treat them like shit, or anything else.

  ## 3. Listen to the staff
  Again, they're higher than your captain. If they tell you to do something - **do it**. It's their place, you have no authority here.

  ## 4. Abide by the law
  By default, all trade stations operate under standard law (Jobs->Security->Law), which means Abide By It. Don't enter property without permission, don't assault random members of the crew, and other standard stuff.

  ## 5. Clean up
  Don't use trade stations as a place to dump your shit and leave. If you cause rot, leave bodies, or more, at least Try to clean it.
