  # Guns And You
  Weapons are the main way of fighting off attackers - or becoming the attacker.

  ## Weapons
  All weapons are either [color=#a4885c]silo-fed[/color] or [color=#a4885c]not silo-fed[/color].
  - Silo-fed weapons require you to load a specific type of missile (usually the same tier or higher rated missile).
  - Not silo-fed weapons do not require you to load anything, and recharge automatically.

  ## Weapon Pads
  The weapon pad is the main way of controlling weapons. Here are the controls:
  - In order to change your target, you can use the top-left dropdown menu. [color=#a4885c]It will only target valid ships (e.g. not trade stations)[/color].
  - In order to choose the position you shoot at, you use the [color=#a4885c]right click[/color] button. Reminder that the position may be inaccurate, and it may take a bit of adjusting to get used to.
  - In order to fire, you click the [color=#a4885c]Fire[/color] button in the top-right corner.

  Please do remember that hull damage is not dependent on your right-click, rather only your selected target. Do not shoot yourself to mine rocks.

  ## Roundstart
  On roundstart, depending on the map, you will usually start with [color=#a4885c]one silo-fed weapon[/color] and [color=#a4885c]one non silo-fed weapon[/color], alongside the ammunition for said weaponry.

  The weapons and weapon pads may not be linked by default, and it is best to ask engineering to either double check or link it. Better safe than sorry.
