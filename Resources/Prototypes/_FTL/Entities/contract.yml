    content: The captain and crew are not liable for your death. You are expendable to the crew. You are a "fill-in" which means any individual that is not a deckhand and is aboard this crew may ask you to perform a department's duties. An example of this is when a mercenary requests you to man starboard guns, or when an engineer tells you to start the drive.
