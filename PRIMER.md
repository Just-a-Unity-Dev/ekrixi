# ::: basic lore exposition (revision 2) :::

we went interstellar, the empire of humanity spanned 250 stars, before the gods punished us by splitting us from the rest of the Core - humanity's abode, full of technological wonders. until a hundred-star long void full of nothing appeared. that's what our radars, sensors, and our eyes told us - until a spinavi-drive beyond safe-power broke it, and we entered **the Veil**.

## ::: the ship you live on :::

your captain assembles some papers, informing you that each warp may take days, and you will have to enter cryogenic storage in between warps to ration out the food. the ship contains damaged cryogenic systems, as all ships do, and some people may be overfrozen or underfrozen, both killing them in their sleep. they inform you that the veil enjoys eating anything that breaks through it's walls like the white blood cells of your immune system. it will eat the ship, it will eat the air, it will eat the pipes, and it will slowly eat you via **V**eil **I**ndividual **E**xposure (VIE).

once the ship launches and breaks through the walls of the veil, it is not turning back until it reaches the Core. a thousand ships of fools have tried this, a thousand ships of fools have died trying. should your ship eventually succumb to the Veil's rust, you will need to do something about it. for nothing is permanent in the veil, you may have to fill a hull breach with wood, or fix a wire with electrical tape, or duct tape a hissing pipe. replacing things are expensive and require time, both of which you may not have.

despite this, you sign the papers. he lets you on with the clothes you signed up in, and you enter the cold metal cryogenic plates. as the cryogenic sleeper shuts it's green glass panels, the last thing you hear is gas hissing and the ship rumbling fast, before passing out.
